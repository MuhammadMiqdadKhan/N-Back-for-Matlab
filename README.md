# N-Back-for-Matlab
This is an implementation of the dual n-back task for Matlab, similar to Brain Workshop (http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/). Dual n-back is widely used as a cognitive psychology task to measure and/or train working memory. This implementation offers many customization options and may be suitable for research, including within the MRI scanner. For instance, you can precisely control the number of lure or interference trials (i.e., n-back +/- 1). Lure trials require executive control to avoid indicating a match in error.  If you use the software in research or a commercial application, please cite it as:
